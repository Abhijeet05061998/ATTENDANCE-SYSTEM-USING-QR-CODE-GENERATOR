# ATTENDANCE-SYSTEM-USING-QR-CODE-GENERATOR
In this era of technology, smartphones play a significant role in our day to day life.
Nowadays smartphones can solve most of the problems very quickly and easily. It has made
a life of every person simple and easier with a different social app, commercial app, problem-solving app, app for education and marketing, etc. Followed by the technology the paper
purposed a system that will handle a problem for recording the attendance. The proposed
system is a couple of two applications, one for generating the QR Code by entering the
student details and second application for taking the attendance and generating the
attendance in CSV or XLS format. The teacher will need to scan the QR code of the particular
student in order to confirm their attendance. The paper discusses how the system verifies
student identity to eliminate false registrations. The system deals with the management and
evaluation of the attendance of all students. The student QR code will be provided to professor
for taking their attendance. The professor handling the subjects is responsible to mark the
attendance for all students of the group or class. The attendance will be marked as 0 and 1, 0
for absent and 1 for the present in the database of the particular student row in the table. The
student attendance reports will be generated in CSV and XLS sheet for further use.
